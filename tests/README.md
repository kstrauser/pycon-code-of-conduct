Python loves testing. A Code of Conduct is strikingly similar to a package that asserts certain behaviors and maps input actions to output consequences.

We should be able to define test cases that define the desired outcomes of various situations, both as a way of ensuring that our Code of Conduct actually handles those cases as intended and to document those anticipated results.

Such test cases should also give us concrete examples for which we can gather concensus of the desired outcomes or realize that a group decision may not be possible.
